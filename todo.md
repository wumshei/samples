TODO
1: Collect alternative dataset:
    model has 0.86% accuracy on training data. this could be a case of overfitting however,
    need to get a similar sized dataset, preferably via splice and use the ausamplesorter text only files to create a dataset unseen to the model. if there is poor preformance, train on this additional dataset and then repeat with another
    if collecting off splice, use different sample packs. samples are likely biased towards the genres that i work with (dnb, trap, hip hop, ect;)
