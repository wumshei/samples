model theories:
    ignore amplitude (or normalise)
    frequency density
    amplitude density
    frequency content (for low end)


MODEL IDEA:
K nearest neighbours on the key features that distinguish a specific drum-type ie;
kicks are identified by a strong low end frequency content compared to other drums
and then genre could be defined by similarities in that low end frequency content (and others obviously) via k nearest neighbours
